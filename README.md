# DC_Motor_Controller
It's a fun project on MATLAB-Simulink and MATLAP App Designer. It takes some Motor's Parameters, Desired Speed and Simulation Time as input, then run the Simulink Model at the back end and finally shows 3 plots on speed, voltage, current vs time. You can also maximize any of the plots or get more step's information.
